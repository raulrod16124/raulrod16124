# Hey there👋!

I'm a **Frontend Developer** with a passion for 🚀 **React**, 🔧 **Typescript**, 🧪 Testing Library, 🌀 Vite, 📱 React Native, and 💅 Styled Components. 

I'm always on the move, bringing a 😄 cheerful and **proactive** attitude to every project. When I'm not **coding**, you'll find me hitting the gym for some 🏋️‍♂️ **CrossFit** sessions.  In my free time, I love creating my applications with the exciting goal of eventually publishing them for the world to enjoy!

Take a look 👀:

I thrive in collaborative environments, cherish **teamwork**, and let's not forget my deep love for ☕ **coffee**! Let's connect and code something **amazing** together! 💻🤝
